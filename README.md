anatembea is a tool for AnteNatal Assessment of Temporal malaria Epidemiology using Mechanistic models, Bayesian Estimation, and Analysis, an open-source R package, which translates monthly malaria prevalence collected at first antenatal clinic visit (ANC1) into seasonal patterns in malaria transmission and clinical cases. Our framework is underpinned by an established mechanistic model of malaria dynamics, providing the basis for simulating data-informed hypothetical scenarios to evaluate the likely impact of alternative intervention approaches.
