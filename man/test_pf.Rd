\arguments{
\item{data_raw}{Time series data to fit model}

\item{data_raw_pg}{Time series of primigravidae ANC data to fit model}

\item{data_raw_mg}{Time series of multigravidae ANC data to fit model}

\item{n_particles}{Number of particles to be used in pMCMC (default = 200)}

\item{proposal_matrix}{Proposal matrix for MCMC parameters}

\item{max_param}{Ceiling for proposed stochastic parameter (either EIR or betaa) values (default = 1000)}

\item{max_steps}{Maximum steps for particle filter (default = 1e7)}

\item{atol}{atol for particle filter (default = 1e-3)}

\item{rtol}{rtol for particle filter (default = 1e-6)}

\item{n_steps}{Number of MCMC steps in a single chain (default = 500)}

\item{n_threads}{Number of processing threads (default = 4)}

\item{lag_rates}{Number of delay compartments (default = 10)}

\item{state_check}{Run equilibrium checks, if state_check = 1, returns expected deriv values which should equal 0 and sets stochastic model to have EIR constant at init_EIR
If state_check = 1 and seasonality_on = 1, then the deterministic seasonal model is still run, but theta2 is forced to 1, forcing a constant seasonality profile
If state_check = 0, no values are printed}

\item{country}{Name of country (needed if using seasonality model)}

\item{admin_unit}{Name of administrative unit (needed if using seasonality model)}

\item{preyears}{Length of time in years the deterministic seasonal model should run before Jan 1 of the year observations began (default = 2)}

\item{seasonality_on}{Toggle seasonality model run before observed time period (default = 1)}

\item{seasonality_check}{Toggle saving values of seasonality equilibrium (default = 1)}

\item{seed}{Allows user to specify a seed (default = 1L)}

\item{start_pf_time}{Number of days before first observation that particle filter will start (default = 30)}

\item{stoch_param}{Which parameter to test}

\item{comparison}{The comparison function to be used. Either 'u5' which
equates the observed prevalence to prevalence under 5 years old in
the model or 'pgmg' which calculates prevalence in primigravid and
multigravid pregnant women for comparison with observed ANC data. c('u5','pg','sg','mg','pgmg','pgsg','ancall')}
}
\description{
This function sets up and runs a particle MCMC that uses Dust, Odin and MCState
